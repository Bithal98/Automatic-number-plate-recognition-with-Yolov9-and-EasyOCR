# Automatic-number-plate-recognition-with-Yolov9-and-EasyOCR
This project is an end-to-end Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system that uses YOLOv9 for vehicle and number plate detection and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for extracting text from license plates. It is designed to work with videos or images and is capable of detecting and recognizing number plates with high accuracy.
